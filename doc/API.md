# API Testing

## Frisby
[Frisby](http://frisbyjs.com/) is an automated API testing tool that lets you make assertions against return values from
APIs. It uses Jasmine for assertions, so you should be comfortable writing useful test cases.

## Postman
[Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en) is a
useful Chrome extension that allows for import/exportable environments and collections out of the box. For something
like $10, you can get an upgrade to automated testing. There's also a CLI runner called Newman that I haven't yet had a
chance to explore, but it sounds pretty cool. There's a [sample collection](postman-collections/stackoverflow.json) with
a couple Stack Overflow API requests to get you started.

## SOAP UI
Well-established, lots of useful tuts on YouTube and other internets. Allows for executing groups of requests like
Postman, and maybe some validation of results. Boring and ugly.

## Paw
[Paw](http://luckymarmot.com/paw) is a pretty, native Mac HTTP Client. It offers collections, environments, testing, and
code generation. It's the best.
